# 2. Data Preparation
# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data[['G1', 'G2']]  # Use relevant columns
y = data['G3']

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
